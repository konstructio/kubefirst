## Install with ASDF ([asdf-kubefirst](https://github.com/Claywd/asdf-kubefirst)) 
  *Not maintained by kubefirst*
  
It's best to run latest but if you already have asdf setup and prefer to use it, there is a kubefirst plugin available to get kubefirst installed and running quickly with asdf.

Installation instructions for asdf are here. Confirm its installed with `asdf version`
    The [asdf-kubefirst plugin is here](https://github.com/Claywd/asdf-kubefirst)

Once you have asdf installed, just run the following commands kubefirst will be up and running.

```zsh
asdf plugin-add kubefirst https://github.com/Claywd/asdf-kubefirst.git;
asdf install kubefirst latest;
asdf global kubefirst;
kubefirst version; 
```
