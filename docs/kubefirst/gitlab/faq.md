# Frequently Asked Questions

## I ran into an issue, what should I try?

If an error occurrs during install or uninstall, you can often just run the command again. There's a `~/.kubefirst` file on your localhost that keeps track of your execution state. If rerunning doesn't work, move on to the next step.

## I can't figure out what to do next - what now?

Open an issue against the kubefirst/kubefirst repo on github. We'll gladly work through it with you.
