# Metaphor

`metaphor` is an example containerized nodejs application that serves numerous purposes on the pro platform.

### Best Practices

`metaphor` provides a demonstration space for application best practices in a tangible way that's easy to apply to other projects. When engineers discover good patterns and wish have those patterns adopted in other projects, add that new idea in the most straightforward way possible to the `metaphor` app as well. By doing so our engineering team can fully engage with the best application approaches.

### CI/CD

`metaphor` has a complete ci/cd process with automated builds, container creation, container publishing, linting, tests, deployment to preprod and production, release management, version management, and hotfixes. It serves as an excellent proving ground for changes to the ci/cd layer.

When a new version of our CI is needed, it's best to adopt that new version of the CI in `metaphor` first. Run through the adjustments to your automation and test it through all of your environments and kubernetes clusters without impacting the applications that your engineers and users depend on.

### Kubernetes Representations

`metaphor` is a multi-instance load balanced nodejs app. It's deployed to the `development` and `staging` namespaces in the `preprod` cluster, and the `production` namespace in the `production` cluster.

The kubernetes manifests produced by the `metaphor` CI include a working example of a kubernetes deployment with downstream replicaset and pods, a service account with a security context used, a service to make the application available to the cluster, and an ingress to make the service available outside the cluster.

### Ingress Integrations

The ingress manifest demonstrates integration with our automated approach to dns management, load balancer management, and TLS/SSL certificate creation and renewal.

``` yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
    # Change the next line to "letsencrypt-staging" while testing adjustments, change to "letsencrypt-prod" after confirming LE certificate was issued
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: "letsencrypt-prod"
  name: metaphor
  labels:
    run: metaphor
spec:
  rules:
    - host: metaphor-development.yourdomain.com
      http:
        paths:
          - backend:
              serviceName: metaphor
              servicePort: 3000
            path: /
  tls:
    - secretName: metaphor-tls
      hosts:
        - metaphor-development.yourdomain.com
```

Some cool automated things to note:
- the value specified in `spec.rules.host` will automatically create a route53 cname that's bound to the ingress' elastic load balancer
- the `cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer` annotation will prompt `cert-manager` to automatically create a certificate for your application, and will store that cert in the `secretName` specified
- nginx will automatically route traffic to the `metaphor` service based on the path-based/host-based routing specified in `spec.rules`

### Environment Configs and Secrets

`metaphor` also includes a working example of how to leverage a multi-environment secrets management paradigm powered by `vault` and `external-secrets`.

There's also a configmap implementation to demonstrate how to leverage non-sensitive configuration values.

### Datadog Integrations

`metaphor` is set up to provide cloud and container observability and monitoring best practices with `datadog`. It demonstrates using `datadog` for `metaphor`'s application logs, container statistics, application metrics, appliction performance monitoring, dashboarding, and alerting.

### Secrets Management

`metaphor` leverages hashicorp `vault` for secrets management. `vault` runs in the `mgmt` cluster and metaphor runs in `preprod` and `production`, so it serves as an example for secrets management. To read more see our [vault page](vault.md)
