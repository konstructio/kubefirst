# Destroying your Kubefirst local platform

## Automated Teardown

Before you attempt to recreate a Kubefirst local platform, you'll need to destroy your k3d cluster and the git repositories that we created for you using this command:

```bash
kubefirst local destroy
```

## Manual Teardown

If the above command fails to complete due to unforeseen circumstances, you can then manually delete the git repositories named:

- gitops
- metaphor-frontend (only exists if you complete Kubefirst local provisioning)

You also need to delete the GitHub teams named
- developers
- admins

You can then manually delete the k3d cluster with the command `k3d cluster delete kubefirst` or `~/.k1/tools/k3d cluster delete kubefirst` if you don't have k3d installed.

To delete your github assets that we created, log into your personal github and remove the following:

- gitops repo
- metaphor repo
- metaphor-go repo
- metaphor-frontend repo


## Localhost file cleanup

You can clean kubefirst files from your localhost by running

```bash
kubefirst clean
```

This command will remove the following content:

- `~/.kubefirst`
- `~/.k1/*`
