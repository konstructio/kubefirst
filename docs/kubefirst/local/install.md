# Local Installation with the Kubefirst CLI

**Kubefirst** is the name of our command line tool that installs the Kubefirst platform to your local or cloud environment.

To use the local version of Kubefirst, you will need to have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). You will also need a GitHub account: GitLab for local, and local git repositories are not supported yet.

## Step 1 - Download (or upgrade) the Kubefirst CLI

```shell
brew install kubefirst/tools/kubefirst
```

There are a few other ways to install Kubefirst for different operating systems, architectures, and containerized environments. See our [installation README](https://github.com/kubefirst/kubefirst/blob/main/build/README.md) for non-brew details.

To upgrade an existing Kubefirst install to the latest version run

```shell
brew update
brew upgrade kubefirst
```

## Step 2 - Create your new local cluster

To create a new Kubefirst cluster locally, run

```shell
kubefirst local
```

### GitHub Authorization during install

The `kubefirst local` command will request that you authorize the Kubefirst CLI to be able to manage Git repositories in your personal GitHub account. It needs this access to add 4 repositories to your account. To do this you'll copy a code that's sent to your terminal, paste it in a GitHub auth page that opens, and hit the `Authorize` button.

#### Why the Kubefirst cli needs this access

The [gitops repo](https://github.com/kubefirst/gitops-template) that we create for you will power your local Kubefirst platform. The [metaphor-frontend](https://github.com/kubefirst/metaphor-frontend-template) repo is your microservice example, which demonstrate how to publish and gitops-deliver applications to your new development, staging, and production namespaces in your new local cluster.

### Super powers user needs and Certificates to deal with HTTPS locally.

To increase the experience of Cloud running Kubefirst locally, we use [Mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) to generate local certificates and serve `https` with Linkerd Ingress Controller.
During installation, we generate these certificates and push them to Kubernetes as secrets to attach to Ingress resources.
Since the certificates are auto-assigned, the browser doesn't recognize them as trusted certificates. 
To resolve the warning that the browser shows when you access one of your applications,  we recommend to run the command:
```shel
mkcert -install
```
We recommend that you run this command above to avoid asking for your password and that you can understand with transparency why a superuser password is requested.

This step will install the CA (Certificate Authority) of MkCert in your trusted store and will make the browser trust in certificates generated by your Kubefirst local install.

## After installation

After the ~5 minutes installation, your browser will launch a new tab to the [Kubefirst Console application](https://github.com/kubefirst/console), which will help you navigate your new suite of tools running in your local k3d cluster.
