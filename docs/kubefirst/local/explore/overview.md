`kubefirst local` provides URLs and passwords that point to local applications. These applications are hosted using [k3d](https://k3d.io) a lightweight wrapper to run k3s (Rancher Labâ€™s minimal Kubernetes distribution)

If you close the handoff screen (by pressing ESC), you can still access the [Kubefirst Console](https://kubefirst.localdev.me) to see all applications, and their local endpoints by opening the Console app.

A newly provisoned local Kubefirst cluster contains the following content installed in it:

| Application                  | Description                                                                 |

| Metaphor Frontend            | (development, staging, production) instance of sample Next.js and React app |

- These apps are all managed by Argo CD and the app configurations are in the `gitops` repo's `registry` folder.

## Accessing the Kubefirst Applications

The Console UI will provide you with the URLs to access the applications that were provisioned, and the handoff screen will provide the credentials to login into these applications.

After closing the handoff screen, you can also have access to the same credentials via the `~/.kubefirst` file, that hosts the initial credentials for all the installed applications.

Note: please ensure Docker is running on your computer. Without docker you will not be able to acces the k3d resources generated for you.

## Learning the Ropes

We've tried our best to provide the available customizations and patterns of the Kubefirst platform here on our docs site. We've also made [links available](../../credit.md) to all of our open source tool's sources of documentation.

You can [reach out to us](../../../community/index.md) if you have any issues along the way. We're also available for consultation of where you should take the platform based on your organization's needs. We know the technologies inside and out and would love to help you do the same.
