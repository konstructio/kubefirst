# GitHub Repositories

When you install the civo version of kubefirst, 2 new repositories will be added to your organization's github account as shown here.

## Repository Summary

`gitops`

The GitOps repo houses all of our IAC and all our GitOps configurations. All of the infrastructure that you receive with Kubefirst was produced by some combination of Terraform and ArgoCD. You can add any infrastructure or application to your platform by pull requesting it to your new `gitops` repository.

`metaphor-frontend`

The `metaphor-frontend` is an example application used to showcase various features of the Kubefirst platform. It has gitops-oriented CI to publish and set the desired state of a development, staging, and production namespace in your new Kubernetes cluster. The metaphor service apps' secrets in
vault are bound to the metaphor app through the use of the external-secrets-operator, a handy Kubernetes utility to keep Kubernetes
secrets in sync with the vault source of truth. It also demonstrates how DNS entries are automatically
created in Route 53 using external-dns. It has auto-renewing, short-lived certificates generated by cert-manager and the Let's Encrypt cluster-issuer.

For more details see [metaphor](../../../explore/metaphor.md).

## GitHub Repository Management

These GitHub repositories are being managed in Terraform.

As you need additional GitHub repositories, just add a new section of Terraform code to `terraform/github/repos.tf`:
```
module "your_repo_name" {
  source = "./modules/repository"
  visibility         = "private"
  repo_name          = "your-repo-name"
  archive_on_destroy = true
  auto_init          = false # set to false if importing an existing repository, set to true if brand new
}
```

## Making Terraform Changes

To make infrastructure and configuration changes with Terraform, simply open a pull request against any of the terraform directory folders in the `gitops` repository.
Your pull request will automatically provide plans, state locks, and applies, and even comment in the merge request 
itself. You'll have a simple, peer reviewable, auditable changelog of all infrastructure and configuration changes.
