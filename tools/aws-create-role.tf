# Terraform plan to create the administrator role that will be assumed

# Replace the AWS account ID `111111111111` with yours.

# To run this plan:
# terraform init
# terraform apply

  # Below is a permissive role not intended for long-term use.
  #
  # It grants all IAM users of the AWS account the ability to assume the role `AssumedAdmin` (or whatever name you gave it), which we created and give the `AdministratorAccess` policy.
  #
  # The value `:root` grants assume to the whole account but you can replace it with your individual IAM ARN, or your role if appropriate.
  #
  # As a reminder, the value `111111111111` below should be replaced with your AWS account ID.
  #
  # Anyone with IAM can assume the role while it's in place like this. You can scope it down to your specific user, or across accounts, or whatever you need.
