# Things we need to work through outside of content:
# publish process needs to be automated (wait for 1.9 so it can be done on github?)
# preprod environment needed with auth protection from crawlers
# need short videos all over the docs
# need to be able to take full advantage of material's bundled plugins for mkdocs publish in cloudfront
# need to implement versions
